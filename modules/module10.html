<h3><em>Separation of Content and design:</em></h3>
<P> My design practices have been successful, though at times I have found it hard to correctly use some of the css design properties, which in turn has slowed down the presentation process. The css I do have is currently being used for items that can be found on every page, such as the header, footer, and navigation. While I now know that creating a bare skeleton of each page would have been a more efficient route, at the time I thought coding for the 
repititious items would be the easiest part and in turn the place for me to start. Once I began to map out those sections of my site, I went quickly to a newsource page to start coding. I oppened a new html file and a pairing css file, which I immediately linked into the head tag. I then side by side worked to establish the items above the way I wanted them to look and function. In this effect, I did well in maintaining separate content and presentation pages. Still I have used simple style tags within my HTML file, such as the <strong>strong tag</strong> and the <em>italics tag</em>. I have tried to stay away from using too many style tags directly inline with my html source, however I feel as if those and a few more are exceptions.</p>
<h3><em>Flaws in My Markup:</em></h3>
<p>Besides a general lack of real content on my pages, which in turn lead to a lack of css as well, I believe my markup to be standards compliant and pretty well coded. The one problem I may also be having is writing in code that actually
isn't affecting or targeting a specific piece of content. Therefore I may be writing unnecessary code. I am still working on deciphering the process of css and how it works on the principle of embedded order (Ex. #navbar ul li {...}). I hope to figure it out soon as I know it is essential to only code what is going to be seen.</p>
<h3><em>Future Development Plans</em></h3>
<p>My future development plans include first and foremost finalizing the code for my navigation and footer, which I have still be fussing with. Once that small step is accomplished I am going to work next on writing in a skeletal base of content in html before I begin to work with it in css. Once everything is on the screen I can then begin to work with css to mold it to the design of my choice.
