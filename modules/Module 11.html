<h3><em>Scrum Team Experience:</em></h3>
<p>One of the first obstacles I remember my SCRUM team facing was actually understanding where and how to write our html pages, or page for me who blindly thought all html files were somehow written on one source page. Though it was an intial problem, it was only a hiccup in the real process. During the rest of the  SCRUM days my team worked somewhat individually only because each of us were at separate stages of the process. Although this happened, I believe it was more to our benefit than anything. All of us had a pretty good comprehension of the subject matter, we were there for each other more for guidence and comparing. And since I tend to work better on my own with projects such as these, not having the constant talking and distrubance allowed me to work more efficiently. When any of us were having trouble we could then turn to each other for help. If none of us knew the answer we easily turned to our other viable options: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a>, <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, and a simple <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> search if neither of those answered our questions. With these resources we all became even more knowledgable about the topic in question, which in turn made us more valuable resources for each other.</p>
<p>As I stated, my teammates and myself included spent a good protion of the time working individually, only reaching out when we needed help, which gave us a more expansive comprehension of the subject. While I myself had a slower start than others, my teammates definitely helped me get my design off the ground. And after I understood better the specific properties of css I was able to really begin putting what I envisioned on the page. With a better understand of it all I wanted to hold myself to the standard of work I knew I could produce, as long as I put the time into it at least. This meant that the design docs that I produced through photoshop were the website design I was aiming for. And too this point in my process I believe I am doing generally a good job. There is still much work to be done to reach my ideal goal and be satisfied, but hopefully I get to that point-if not in this intro class, then further on in my career as a professional writer.</p>
<h3><em>Resources and Support:</em></h3>
<p>As previously stated, when working with my SCRUM team we essentially were limited to other web resources and the help of our professor. Those were enough to answer the somewhat complex questions of html and css. Specifically for me though, when I reached the point in which i started to incorporate jquery into my site was when I turned to a good high school friend of mine who happens to be a web developer well versed in javascript. Over Thanksgiving break he broke down the simple ideas behind jquery, and in turn javascript, to me. He also provided me with the source pages from a website he previously built to work as a reference for any questions I might have. He also offerred his close attention to me if I were to reach out to him with questions. While most of javascript language is still complex to me, I am thankful for my friend's help and guidance which gave me a better general understand of coding.</p>
