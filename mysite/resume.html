        	<p><strong>Philanthropy Chairman</strong><br>
            Being the Philanthropy Chairman for the Michigan Beta Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi I am responsible for planning, organizing, and directing two full scale philanthropy events per academic year. Within this responsibility I must communicate with community and campus officials, obtain partnerships and/or sponsorships with local businesses and organizations, and lead fellow committee members to reach our goals.</p>
            <p><strong>Corresponding Secretary</strong><br>
            As Corresponding Secretary I was responsible for the communication between Phi Kappa Psi's national headquarters and my local chapter. With that I compiled and organized any outgoing or incoming information, and I maintained up to date records of my chapter's membership, as well as other aspects. Also, with this position, I wrote for and represented my chapter in Phi Kappa Psi's national magazine: <em>The Shield.</em></p>

    	<p><strong>Community Service Chairman</strong><br>
        As Phi Kappa Psi's community service coordinator I have been at the forefront of organizing our 1st and 2nd annual Giving Tree projects-a community service project that provides Christmas gifts to the Boys and Girls Club of Lansing. Each year, of the past 2 years, this event has raised and donated over 100 gifts to the Boys and Girls Club.</p>
        <p><strong>Communications Specialist</strong><br>
        As a communications specials for Michigan State's CAMP program, I worked within a group to create a deliverable that would solve one of the program's problems. I focused on solving the problem that their students did not have the information and resources needed to actively enroll in a health care program. To solve this, my group implemented a informational packet that covered the basics all the way to enrollment action; we identified frequently asked questions, the two most viable plans for them within Michigan, and realistic steps toward enrollment.</p>
