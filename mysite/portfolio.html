<p>Here above you can find a few examples of my writing to date. While I have little work that is professional, I believe these pieces of work best exemplify my writing style and expertise in the field. The first piece, "CAMP Care", is an informational heath care packet I created with another class member for Michigan State's CAMP Program. My work on this piece clearly demonstrates how I have cohesively protrayed viable information and effectively tailored to a target audience. My second piece, "Whale-come to Vineyard Vines", is a paper I wrote analyzing the rhetorical tatics and advertising schemes of Vineyard Vines. This piece shows I am able to research and analyze information well. And finally my last piece of work, "Positive Psychology" is an essay I wrote for my senior exit project in English class. Not only do I have very personal ties to this piece of work, but it also proves I can adequately research, write, and present with close attention to detail and with effective fact-finding skills.</p>

<p> Here above you can find my progression of work as a novice web designer. All the work seen above was done for an introductory web design class I took here at Michigan State. Starting with zero knowledge whatsoever of servers, design principles, and coding I worked my way into better understanding all of these as the semester went along. Therefore from the creation of a sitemap to fully designed mockups, the links above display my progression from a simple understanding of web design to actually putting the knowledge I had gained to work.</p>

<p>Here above you can view posters for both the events I have coordinated and organized through being the Philanthropy Chairman of Phi Kappa Psi at Michigan State. While both these posters are only slight references to the actual work that has been put behind each event, they highlight the general information of both. But to briefly explain each, The Giving Tree is a community outreach event in which Phi Kappa Psi paired with the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lansing to provide the children involved in their program with presents just in time for Christmas. Through the efforts of this event, Phi Kappa Psi has been able to raise and donate 200+ gifts for two years running. Similarly, Miles for MDA is a philanthropic 5k/10k race in which all the proceeds benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Greater Lansing. While this event isn't scheduled till the spring of 2015, Phi Kappa Psi hopes to raise 10,000 dollars to donate to those children who are suffering from neuromuscular diseases.</p>
